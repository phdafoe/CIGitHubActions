######*fastlane* lets you define and run your deployment pipelines for different environments. It helps you unify your apps release process and automate the whole process. fastlane connects all fastlane tools and third party tools, like [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) and [Slack](https://slack.com).

## Features

Why should you have to remember complicated commands and parameters?

Store your configuration in a text file to easily test, build, and deploy from _any_ computer.

[Take a look at how Wikipedia and Product Hunt use `fastlane`](https://github.com/fastlane/examples).

Define different environments (`lanes`) in your `Fastfile`: Examples are: `appstore`, `beta` and `test`.

You define a `lane` like this (more details about the commands in the [Actions](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Actions.md) documentation):

```ruby
lane :appstore do
  increment_build_number
  cocoapods
  scan
  snapshot
  match
  deliver
  sh "./customScript.sh"

  slack
end
```

To launch the `appstore` lane, just run:

```sh
fastlane appstore
```

## Installation

I recommend following the [fastlane guide](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Guide.md) to get started.

    sudo gem install fastlane --verbose

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

If you experience slow launch times of fastlane, try running

    gem cleanup

to clean up outdated gems.

System Requirements: `fastlane` requires Mac OS X or Linux with Ruby 2.0.0 or above.


If you want to take a look at a project, already using `fastlane`, check out the [fastlane-examples](https://github.com/fastlane/examples) with `fastlane` setups by Wikipedia, Product Hunt, MindNode and more.

## Quick Start

The setup assistant will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunes Connect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```fastlane init```
- Follow the setup assistant, which will set up ```fastlane``` for you
- Further customise the ```Fastfile``` with [actions](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Actions.md).

For more details, please follow the [fastlane guide](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Guide.md) or [documentation](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane/docs).

There are also 2 Japanese fastlane guides available: [qiita](http://qiita.com/gin0606/items/a8573b582752de0c15e1) and [mercari](http://tech.mercari.com/entry/2015/07/13/143000)

## Available commands

Usually you'll use fastlane by triggering individual lanes:

    fastlane [lane_name]

#### Other commands

- `fastlane actions`: List all available `fastlane` actions
- `fastlane action [action_name]`: Shows a more detailed description of an action
- `fastlane lanes`: Lists all available lanes with description
- `fastlane list`: Lists all available lanes without description
- `fastlane new_action`: Create a new action (integration) for fastlane

## Examples

See how [Wikipedia](https://github.com/fastlane/examples#wikipedia-by-wikimedia-foundation), [Product Hunt](https://github.com/fastlane/examples#product-hunt) and [MindNode](https://github.com/fastlane/examples#mindnode) use `fastlane` to automate their iOS submission process.

## [`fastlane`](https://fastlane.tools) Toolchain

`fastlane` is designed to make your life easier by bringing together all `fastlane` tools

- [`deliver`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/deliver): Upload screenshots, metadata and your app to the App Store
- [`snapshot`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot): Automate taking localized screenshots of your iOS app on every device
- [`frameit`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/frameit): Quickly put your screenshots into the right device frames
- [`pem`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/pem): Automatically generate and renew your push notification profiles
- [`sigh`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/sigh): Because you would rather spend your time building stuff than fighting provisioning
- [`produce`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/produce): Create new iOS apps on iTunes Connect and Dev Portal using the command line
- [`cert`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/cert): Automatically create and maintain iOS code signing certificates
- [`spaceship`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/spaceship): Ruby library to access the Apple Dev Center and iTunes Connect
- [`pilot`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/pilot): The best way to manage your TestFlight testers and builds from your terminal
- [`boarding`](https://github.com/fastlane/boarding): The easiest way to invite your TestFlight beta testers
- [`gym`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/gym): Building your iOS apps has never been easier
- [`match`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/match): Easily sync your certificates and profiles across your team using git

## Statistics

`fastlane` tracks the number of errors for each action to detect integration issues. The data will be sent to [fastlane-enhancer](https://github.com/fastlane/enhancer).

You can easily opt-out by adding `opt_out_usage` to your `Fastfile` or by setting the environment variable `FASTLANE_OPT_OUT_USAGE`. To also disable update checks, set the `FASTLANE_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK` variable.

## Credentials
A detailed description about how `fastlane` stores your credentials is available on a [separate repo](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/credentials_manager).
