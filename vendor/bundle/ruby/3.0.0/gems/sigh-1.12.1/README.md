###### Because you would rather spend your time building stuff than fighting provisioning

`sigh` can create, renew, download and repair provisioning profiles (with one command). It supports App Store, Ad Hoc, Development and Enterprise profiles and supports nice features, like auto-adding all test devices.

# Features

- **Download** the latest provisioning profile for your app
- **Renew** a provisioning profile, when it has expired
- **Repair** a provisioning profile, when it is broken
- **Create** a new provisioning profile, if it doesn't exist already
- Supports **App Store**, **Ad Hoc** and **Development** profiles
- Support for **multiple Apple accounts**, storing your credentials securely in the Keychain
- Support for **multiple Teams**
- Support for **Enterprise Profiles**

To automate iOS Push profiles you can use [pem](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/pem).

### Why not let Xcode do the work?

- ```sigh``` can easily be integrated into your CI-server (e.g. Jenkins)
- Xcode sometimes invalidates [all existing profiles](assets/SignErrors.png)
- You have control over what happens
- You still get to have the signing files, which you can then use for your build scripts or store in git

See ```sigh``` in action:

![assets/sighRecording.gif](assets/sighRecording.gif)

# Installation

**Note**: It is recommended to use [match](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/match) according to the [codesigning.guide](https://codesigning.guide) for generating and maintaining your provisioning profiles. Use `sigh` directly only if you want full control over what's going on and know more about codesigning.

    sudo gem install sigh

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

# Usage

    sigh
Yes, that's the whole command!

```sigh``` will create, repair and download profiles for the App Store by default.

You can pass your bundle identifier and username like this:

    sigh -a com.krausefx.app -u username

If you want to generate an **Ad Hoc** profile instead of an App Store profile:

    sigh --adhoc

If you want to generate a **Development** profile:

    sigh --development

To generate the profile in a specific directory:

    sigh -o "~/Certificates/"

To download all your provisioning profiles use

    sigh download_all

For a list of available parameters and commands run

    sigh --help

### Advanced

By default, ```sigh``` will install the downloaded profile on your machine. If you just want to generate the profile and skip the installation, use the following flag:

    sigh --skip_install

To save the provisioning profile under a specific name, use the -q option:

    sigh -a com.krausefx.app -u username -q "myProfile.mobileprovision"

If for some reason you don't want `sigh` to verify that the code signing identity is installed on your local machine:

    sigh --skip_certificate_verification

If you need the provisioning profile to be renewed regardless of its state use the `--force` option. This gives you a profile with the maximum lifetime. `--force` will also add all available devices to this profile.

    sigh --force

By default, `sigh` will include all certificates on development profiles, and first certificate on other types. If you need to specify which certificate to use you can either use the environment variable `SIGH_CERTIFICATE`, or pass the name or expiry date of the certificate as argument:

    sigh -c "SunApps GmbH"

For a list of available parameters and commands run

    sigh --help


### Use with [`fastlane`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane)

`sigh` becomes really interesting when used in [`fastlane`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane) in combination with [`cert`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/cert).

Update your `Fastfile` to contain the following code:

```ruby
lane :beta do
  cert
  sigh(force: true)
end
```

`force: true` will make sure to re-generate the provisioning profile on each run.
This will result in `sigh` always using the correct signing certificate, which is installed on the local machine.


# Repair

`sigh` can automatically repair all your existing provisioning profiles which are expired or just invalid.

    sigh repair


# Resign

If you generated your `ipa` file but want to apply a different code signing onto the ipa file, you can use `sigh resign`:


    sigh resign

`sigh` will find the ipa file and the provisioning profile for you if they are located in the current folder.

You can pass more information using the command line:

    sigh resign ./path/app.ipa --signing_identity "iPhone Distribution: Felix Krause" -p "my.mobileprovision"

# Manage

With `sigh manage` you can list all provisioning profiles installed locally.

    sigh manage

Delete all expired provisioning profiles

    sigh manage -e

Or delete all `iOS Team Provisioning Profile` by using a regular expression

    sigh manage -p "iOS\ ?Team Provisioning Profile:"

## Environment Variables

Run `sigh --help` to get a list of all available environment variables.

If you're using [cert](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/cert) in combination with [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane) the signing certificate will automatically be selected for you. (make sure to run `cert` before `sigh`)

# How does it work?

`sigh` will access the `iOS Dev Center` to download, renew or generate the `.mobileprovision` file. It uses [spaceship](https://spaceship.airforce) to communicate with Apple's web services.


## How is my password stored?
`sigh` uses the [CredentialsManager](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/credentials_manager) from `fastlane`.

## Use the 'Provisioning Quicklook plugin'
Download and install the [Provisioning Plugin](https://github.com/chockenberry/Provisioning).

It will show you the `mobileprovision` files like this:
![assets/QuickLookScreenshot.png](assets/QuickLookScreenshot.png)

## App Identifier couldn't be found

If you also want to create a new App Identifier on the Apple Developer Portal, check out [produce](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/produce), which does exactly that.

## What happens to my Xcode managed profiles?

`sigh` will never touch or use the profiles which are created and managed by Xcode. Instead `sigh` will manage its own set of provisioning profiles.
