<h5 align="center">The <code>frameit</code> 2.0 update was kindly sponsored by <a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a>, seen in the screenshots above.

# Installation

Make sure, you have the commandline tools installed

    xcode-select --install

Install the gem

    sudo gem install frameit

Because of legal reasons, I can not pre-package the device frames with ```frameit```.

The process of adding is really easy, just run ```frameit``` and the guide will help you set it up.
You only have to do this once per computer.

- Run ```frameit```
- Press ```Enter```. The [Apple page](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#images) to download the images should open in your browser.
- Download the devices you want to use
- Press ```Enter```
- Unzip and move the content of the zip files to ```~/.frameit/devices_frames```
- Press ```Enter```

# Usage

Why should you have to use Photoshop, just to add a frame around your screenshots?

Just navigate to your folder of screenshots and use the following command:

    frameit

To use the silver version of the frames:

    frameit silver

To run the setup process again to add new frames use:

    frameit setup

When using `frameit` without titles on top, the screenshots will have the full resolution, which means they can't be uploaded to the App Store directly. They are supposed to be used for websites, print media and emails. Check out the section below to use the screenshots for the App Store.

# Titles and Background (optional)

With `frameit` 2.0 you are now able to add a custom background, title and text colors to your screenshots.

A working example can be found in the [fastlane examples](https://github.com/fastlane/examples/tree/master/MindNode/screenshots) project.

#### `Framefile.json`

Use it to define the general information:

```json
{
  "default": {
    "keyword": {
      "font": "./fonts/MyFont-Rg.otf"
    },
    "title": {
      "font": "./fonts/MyFont-Th.otf",
      "color": "#545454"
    },
    "background": "./background.jpg",
    "padding": 50,
    "show_complete_frame": false
  },

  "data": [
    {
      "filter": "Brainstorming",
      "keyword": {
        "color": "#d21559"
      }
    },
    {
      "filter": "Organizing",
      "keyword": {
        "color": "#feb909"
      }
    },
    {
      "filter": "Sharing",
      "keyword": {
        "color": "#aa4dbc"
      }
    },
    {
      "filter": "Styling",
      "keyword": {
        "color": "#31bb48"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
The `show_complete_frame` value specifies whether `frameit` should shrink the device and frame so that they show in full in the framed screenshot. If it is false, then they can hang over the bottom of the screenshot.

The `filter` value is a part of the screenshot named for which the given option should be used. If a screenshot is named `iPhone5_Brainstorming.png` the first entry in the `data` array will be used.

You can find a more complex [configuration](https://github.com/fastlane/examples/blob/master/MindNode/screenshots/Framefile.json) to also support Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages.

The `Framefile.json` should be in the `screenshots` folder, as seen in the [example](https://github.com/fastlane/examples/tree/master/MindNode/screenshots).

#### `.strings` files

To define the title and optionally the keyword, put two `.strings` files into the language folder (e.g. [en-US in the example project](https://github.com/fastlane/examples/tree/master/MindNode/screenshots/en-US))

The `keyword.strings` and `title.strings` are standard `.strings` file you already use for your iOS apps, making it easy to use your existing translation service to get localized titles.

**Note:** These `.strings` files **MUST** be utf-16 encoded (UTF-16 LE with BOM).  They also must begin with an empty line. If you are having trouble see [issue #1740](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/1740)

**Note:** You **MUST** provide a background if you want titles. `frameit` will not add the tiles if a background is not specified.

#### Uploading screenshots to iTC

Use [deliver](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/deliver) to upload all screenshots to iTunes Connect completely automatically :rocket:

### Mac

With `frameit` 2.0 it's possible to also frame macOS Application screenshots. You have to provide the following:

- The `offset` information so `frameit` knows where to put your screenshots
- A path to a `background`, which should contain both the background and the Mac
- `titleHeight`: The height in px that should be used for the title

##### Example
```json
{
  "default": {
    "title": {
      "color": "#545454"
    },
    "background": "Mac.jpg",
    "offset": {
      "offset": "+676+479",
      "titleHeight": 320
    }
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "filter": "Brainstorming",
      "keyword": {
        "color": "#d21559"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Generate localized screenshots
Check out [`snapshot`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot) to automatically generate screenshots using ```UI Automation```.

## Alternative location to store device_frames

Device frames can also be stored in a ```./fastlane/screenshots/devices_frames``` directory if you prefer rather than in the ```~/.frameit/device_frames``` directory. If doing so please be aware that Apple's images are copyrighted and should not be redistributed as part of a repository so you may want to include them in your .gitignore file.

## White background of frames

Some stock images provided by Apple still have a white background instead of a transparent one. You'll have to edit the Photoshop file to remove the white background, delete the generated `.png` file and run `frameit` again.

## Use a clean status bar
You can use [SimulatorStatusMagic](https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic) to clean up the status bar.

## Gray artifacts around text

If you run into any quality issues, like having a border around the font, it usually helps to just re-install `imagemagick`. You can do so by running

```sh
brew uninstall imagemagick
brew install imagemagick
```

## Uninstall
- ```sudo gem uninstall frameit```
- ```rm -rf ~/.frameit```
